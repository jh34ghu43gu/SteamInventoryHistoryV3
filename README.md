# SteamInventoryHistoryV3
 Attempt #3, now for use by everyone

# How to use
 1) Install tampermonkey for your web browser, greasemonkey may also work but I have only tested for tampermonkey on firefox.
 2) Create a new userscript and copy the contents of "Tf2 Inventory History Downloader" from the script folder into the new userscript
 3) Go to https://steamcommunity.com/my/inventoryhistory?app%5B0%5D=440&l=english and click the Download as json button.
   Note: If you need to stop, or the script stops itself, make sure to save the cursor that appears in the text input, this will allow you to continue the download from where you left off.
 4) Do something with your json (stat analysis feature coming eventually).
